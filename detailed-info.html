            <h3>Performance Meets Innovation</h3>
            <p>
              Richmond Hill, ON. More power, more dynamic performance, more
              efficiency: The new BMW iX takes the driving experience of the
              all-electric Sports Activity Vehicle to a new level. Consistent
              progress in the field of drive and high-voltage battery technology
              as well as further development of BMW EfficientDynamics measures
              not only increase the power output and sporty driving
              characteristics, but also the efficiency and thus the range of
              BMW's first-ever SAV designed from the beginning to be fully
              electric.

            <h3>Strong performance from every drive system.</h3>
            <p>
              In each of the three model versions of the new BMW iX, a re-tuning
              of the drive system and optimized power electronics result in
              noticeably spirited power delivery. The new BMW iX xDrive45
              delivers a maximum system output 402 hp, which enables a 0-100
              km/h time of just 5.1 seconds. The new BMW iX xDrive60 receives a
              20 hp increase over the previous xDrive50 to 536 and accelerates
              from 0 to 100 km/h in only 4.6 seconds. Both models have an
              electronically limited top speed of 200 km/h.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the very top of the iX line, the new BMW iX M70 xDrive offers
              genuinely exhilerating performance. The dual motors in the iX M70
              xDrive combine to deliver a maximum system output of up to 650 hp
              in My Mode Sport - 40 more than its M60 xDrive predecessor - and a
              maximum torque of 811 lb-ft when Launch Control is activated. The
              new BMW iX M70 xDrive sprints from 0 to 100 km/h in 3.8 seconds,
              on to an electronically limited top speed of 250 km/h when
              equipped with performance tires.

            <h3>Interior: Progressive luxury, refined sportiness.</h3>
            <p>
              The interior ambience of the BMW iX, characterized by generous
              space and progressive luxury, can now be combined with the sporty
              design features of the M Sport Package. New M Multifunction Seats
              offer enhanced lateral support and a striking design. Available
              for the first time in the iX, these seats offer a wide range of
              adjustments, including backrest width adjustment, lumbar support,
              and pronounced contouring in the thigh and shoulder areas. A new
              microfibre/Sensatec upholstery finished in Atlas Grey/Black with
              M-specific stitching and accents in the BMW M tricolour is
              exclusive to the iX M70. The new M Multifunction Seats are also
              optionally available in Amido natural leather and Castanea natural
              leather.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Heat Comfort Package (optional on xDrive45 and xDrive60,
              standard on M70 xDrive) contributes to maximum well-being. Heated
              surfaces for the instrument panel and glove compartment, the door
              panels, centre armrest and the rear seats ensure a comfortable
              temperature for all passengers. The Sky Lounge Panoramic Glass
              Sunroof, optional on xDrive45 and xDrive60 and standard on the M70
              xDrive, enhances the bright and spacious interior with a one-piece
              viewing area that extends over both rows of seats. Instead of a
              roller blind, it features electrochromic shading that can be
              activated at the touch of a button. The Bowers & Wilkins Diamond
              Surround Sound System, with 30 speakers and exciters in the front
              seats, delivers an exceptionally intense and precisely balanced
              sound experience. A Trailer Hitch will be available as an option
              for the new BMW iX in the summer of 2025. For all model variants,
              the maximum permitted towing capacity is 1,587 kg.

            <h3>Wide variety of systems for automated driving and parking.</h3>
            <p>
              To optimize comfort and safety, the new BMW iX offers a wide range
              of systems for automated driving and parking. These are based on
              BMW's latest modular technology kit and set new standards in terms
              of functionality, reliability, and availability. The advanced
              modular technology kit gives the new BMW iX outstanding
              intelligence in environmental monitoring and data processing. It
              also offers the potential for extensive integration of new and
              enhanced functions. These updates and enhancements can be
              installed over-the-air via remote software upgrades or downloaded
              from the BMW ConnectedDrive Store. This means that the BMW iX and
              its software remain conveniently at the cutting edge of
              technology.
